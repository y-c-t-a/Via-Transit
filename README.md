Make plans and navigate Chicago using public transit like a pro! Via Transit allows you to search by name, price, and distance for attractions near you, add destinations to your itinerary, and plan your entire route using the CTA. The app works by querying Yelpâ€™s API with Apollo GraphQL, then renders the suggested attractions on a map. Once an itinerary is finalized, we use Google Directions to provide public transit routes between every destination. As a group, we learned not only how to use the unfamiliar technologies mentioned above, but also how to work together efficiently on a project with a short timeline.
